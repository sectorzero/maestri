Maestri User Manual
-------------------
Maestri is a build tool built on top of scons for GNU/Linux C/C++ development.
The goal of Maestri is to provide a simple, structured, easy-to-use build tool.

Some of the aspects of this build tool are :
- Enforces a simple structure on the C/C++ package which is intuitive and helps
  to organize the project cleanly
- Almost no code required to set-up a build. All that is required by the user is
  his custom module naming, dependencies
- Out of the box support for organizing, writing and building unittests
- Provides build, binary and debugger targets
- Provides targets to execute unittests
- Build artifacts are kept seperate from source files
- Variant builds are built in uniformly into the design

Structure of a Maestri package :
-------------------------------
PackageRoot
+ libraryModule ( 0..n )
    + unittestModule
+ binaryModule ( 0..n )
